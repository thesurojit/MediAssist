            At MediAssist Solutions, we are committed to revolutionizing healthcare accessibility through innovative

        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>
            Our platform utilizes advanced image recognition algorithms to analyze prescriptions uploaded by users. Upon

            from
            our extensive database. Users can quickly access vital details such as drug names, medical conditions, side
            effects, generic names, and more.
